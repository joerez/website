                    article
                        p Notice of a training candidate's intent to cancel a registration must be made in writing to DevChampions and is subject to the following terms:
                        p Training candidates whose cancellation request is received in excess of 14 days prior to the start date of the training activity will incur no liabilities.
                        p Training candidates whose cancellation request is received within 8 to14 days prior to the start date of the training activity will incur an administration fee equal to 50% of the obligated fee.
                        p Training candidates whose cancellation request is received within 7 days prior to the start date or after the commencement of the training activity will incur an administration fee equal to 100% of the obligated fee.
                        p One substitute is permitted per registrant for the entire course; daily substitutions are not permitted. DevChampions must be notified prior to the first day of the course when a substitution will occur.
                        p DevChampions will also allow the registration fee to be applied to a different DevChampions sponsored course. This request must be made in writing, subject to approval by DevChampions, and can be used turning a period of time not exceeding 18 months from the original course registration.
                        p DevChampions reserves the right to cancel courses, change course location, change instructors, or change course content. In the event that a course must be canceled or the location of the course changed, registrants will be informed 15 days prior to the start of the course.
